### Labels
A label is the thing we're predicting—the y variable in simple linear regression. The label could be the future price of wheat, the kind of animal shown in a picture, the meaning of an audio clip, or just about anything.

### Features
A feature is an input variable—the x variable in simple linear regression. A simple machine learning project might use a single feature, while a more sophisticated machine learning project could use millions of features.


### Examples
An example is a particular instance of data, x. (We put x in boldface to indicate that it is a vector.) We break examples into two categories:

- labeled examples
- unlabeled examples

A labeled example includes both feature(s) and the label. That is:
```
labeled examples: {features, label}: (x, y)
```
An unlabeled example contains features but not the label. That is:
```
unlabeled examples: {features, ?}: (x, ?)
```
