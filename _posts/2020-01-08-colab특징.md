### Forms
Forms provide an easy way to parameterize code. From a code cell, select Insert → Add form field. When you change the value in a form, the corresponding value in the code will change.</br>

### Colab Widgets
Colaboratory's widgets enable redirecting future output to a particular place in the layout rather than requiring users to provide preconstructed html. Thus existing code that publishes its own output (such as bokeh, or matplotlib) can be treated as building-blocks from which more complex layouts can be built. Widgets also support a simple protocol for updating and clearing outputs dynamically. </br>
